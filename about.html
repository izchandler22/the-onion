      From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=The_Onion">The Onion</a> is an American digital media company and news satire organization. The publication's origins are rooted in its distribution as a weekly college print publication beginning in 1988, but in the spring of 1996 The Onion put its content online in the form of a website featuring satirical articles reporting on international, national, and local news. Starting in 2007, the organization published satirical news audio and video online, as the Onion News Network. In 2014, the Onion News Network was folded back into the original brand as "the Onion Video".

    The Onion‍ '​s articles comment on current events, both real and fictional. It parodies traditional news organizations with stories, editorials, op-ed pieces, and man-in-the-street interviews using a traditional news website layout and an editorial voice modeled after that of the Associated Press. Its humor often depends on presenting mundane, everyday events as newsworthy, surreal or alarming.

Originally a print publication, The Onion launched its website in 1996.Print publishing ceased in December 2013.
